# Creating an Adder-AFU using Verilog

* Similar example using VHDL: https://github.com/ibm-capi/afu-walkthrough



* Define job structure for AFU in consumer code
* Initialize project
* Implement modules for MMIO communication and job lifecycle management
* Implement work element as state machine
* Consume the AFU using libcxl
