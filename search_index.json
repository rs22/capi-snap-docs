SNAP Development for Programmers\nIntroduction\nIBM CAPI SNAP is an open source framework targeted at making FPGA-acceleration on IBM POWER servers as easy as possible. This book wants to help developers getting started by providing an A-to-Z explanation on how to create an acceleration example in SNAP. It includes setting up the environment, building and simulating the the given examples, creating one by yourself and evaluating it against software. If you have access to an IBM POWER System with a Nallatech 250S (or another compatible) FPGA-card you will also be able to execute examples on the real hardware.\n\nNallatech 250S FPGA\n\nWhy was this written?\nWhen making first steps with IBM CAPI, which is the basis for SNAP, but also requires in-depth understanding of hardware development, the blog seriers \"Tinkering with CAPI\" by Kenneth Wilke helped us immensely. As there was no equivalent for SNAP, we thought writing up our acquired knowledge could help other people get started. It also serves as a report for a corresponding university project and therefore contains information in different levels of detail. Feel free to just pick out what you need.\nWho wrote it?\nThe authors of this book are\n\nBalthasar Martin \nRobert Schmid \nLukas Wenzel \n\nwho are students at the Hasso-Plattner-Institute in Potsdam and constituted the masters project 'Heterogeneous Computing: acceleration and FPGAs in context of POWER and CAPI' . The project was offered at the chair for Operating Systems and Middleware in cooperation with IBM and was supervised by\n\nProf. Dr. Andreas Polze \nFelix Eberhardt \nMax Plauth .\n\nWe also want to thank everyone at IBM who held close contact and helped us during the project, including but not limited to: Frank Haverkamp, Jörg-Stephan Vogt, Sven Boekholt, Thomas Fuchs, Bruno Mesnet and Bruce Wile.\n"},"1-introduction/1-motivation-and-use-cases.html":{"url":"1-introduction/1-motivation-and-use-cases.html","title":"Motivation and use cases","keywords":"","body":"Motivation and use cases\nIn comparison to other hardware accelerators that provide parallel processing capabilities, FPGAs are very flexible in terms of the possible application scenarios (compared to on-chip accelerators) while being orders of magnitude more power-efficient compared to graphics cards (GPGPU acceleration) because of their lower clock frequency.\n\nThanks to their generic structure, FPGAs can be programmed to suit various use cases\n\nTraditionally however, it was very time consuming and difficult for an application programmer to implement FPGA-based accelerators. The type of 'hardware programming' that is necessary is quite different from well-known programming paradigms used in imperative languages such as C or Java. Not only is a detailed knowledge of the targeted FPGA architecture needed to optimize the hardware descriptions; a lot of time is often spent to establish communication channels and management interfaces used by the consuming application.\nIn order to overcome these issues, IBM provides the CAPI and SNAP frameworks discussed here. They allow a broader group of developers to leverage FPGAs for their applications.\nFPGA-based acceleration paradigms\nDepending on the use case it is possible to obtain FPGAs that are equipped with additional external interfaces on the chip (e.g. network and storage interfaces). This extends the possible application scenarios of FPGAs: They can operate 'closer' to the incoming/outgoing data, meaning that a flexible pre-/postprocessing of the data can be implemented transparently to the CPU. The resulting usage paradigms are detailed in the following sections.\nOffloading parallel computation tasks from the CPU to the FPGA\n\nOff-load Method\n\nThis is the most traditional use case for accelerators: The host application provides source- and destination buffers for the task data, invokes the parallel processing action on the accelerator and continues processing once the action completes. Consequently, this approach requires a transfer of the source data from the host to the FPGA and another transfer of the results back to the host. For the time the FPGA is busy, the host CPU is free to perform other tasks; effectively reducing its load compared to a CPU-only implementation of the workload (off-loading).\nReal-world benefits of this approach are however limited by the effective data bandwidth that the underlying bus (e.g. PCIe) supports. Application scenarios should focus on throughput instead of latency (which the CPU is optimized for, with its caches and prefetchers). As a prerequisite, parallelizable application procedures have to be identified and isolated, which can be difficult depending on the use case. Once implemented, the possible performance gains are likely to improve over time because, in contrast to CPUs, GPUs and FPGAs are still expected to significantly increase their computation power per watt over new hardware generations (Dennard scaling).\nExamples: Machine Learning, Genomic algorithms, Erasure Code offload, Deep Computation\nTransforming data before it is sent to network or storage\n\nEgress Method\n\nDepending on the hardware capabilities of the FPGA (i.e. integrated network or storage adapters; on-chip non-volatile memory) this paradigm can be used to transform streaming data directly on the FPGA. Furthermore, CPU load is reduced by taking over I/O operations such as communication with network devices over certain protocols. Application examples include encryption and compression algorithms as well as adding an erasure code prior to sending data to network or storage.\nTransforming or filtering data received from network or storage\n\nIngress Method\n\nThe same technique as above can also be applied in the inverse direction: Communication with external devices is handled by the FPGA and incoming data streams can be pre-processed and filtered. Examples: Video Analytics, Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) and Video Encoding (H.265).\nAggregating data received from multiple external sources\n\nFunnel Engine\n\nIf large amounts of data are received from various different sources, the Ingress paradigm can be extended to become a funnel: This scenario is especially interesting when the combined input bandwidth of all connected external sources is greater than the available bandwidth from the FPGA to the CPU (otherwise: 'drips into the funnel'). One application example could be to pre-filter or pre-aggregate incoming sensor data to reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred via PCIe buses to the CPU. Further use cases include database searches, joins, intersections, and merges.\n"},"1-introduction/2-what-is-capi.html":{"url":"1-introduction/2-what-is-capi.html","title":"What is CAPI?","keywords":"","body":"What is CAPI?\nCAPI, the Coherent Accelerator Processor Interface is an interface standard introduced with IBMs POWER8 server architecture. As the name suggests, it enables accelerators (i.e. FPGAs) to be part of the system's coherent cache hierarchy and memory subsystem formerly only available to CPU cores. Consequently, while former technologies mapped the accelerator to its specific IO memory area, where data had to be copied to explicitly, an accelerator connected via CAPI can access the same virtual address space as its controlling process.\n\nCurrently, a CAPI accelerator card is connected to the system via a PCIe slot. However CAPI itself is independent of the underlying bus system. Therefore subsequent versions of the POWER architecture might introduce different bus systems with higher bandwidths.\n\n\nArchitecture\n\nCAPI Block Diagram\n\nThe block diagram above shows that CAPI consists of several components distributed among the accelerator and host CPU: The logic on the FPGA is split into the application specific AFU (Accelerator Function Unit) part, that implements the accelerator hardware proper, and the PSL (Power Service Layer). The latter is a fixed design provided by IBM, that implements the interface logic necessary to provide cached virtual host memory access and job management services to the AFU.\nThe PSL communicates with the host part of the CAPI hardware, the Coherent Accelerator Processor Proxy (CAPP) via PCIe. The CAPP is part of the POWER CPU and from the point of view of the memory subsystem it has the same status as a processor core.\nThe software part of CAPI, running on regular processor cores, consists of a driver in the linux kernel that exposes cxl devices representing an installed CAPI accelerator card. To encapsulate the interaction with raw cxl devices via read/write and ioctl systemcalls, libcxl provides a C API with the same functionality. Any user application, given sufficient privileges to interact with the cxl device, can use functions from and link against libcxl and thereby use the functions implemented by the AFU on any installed accelerator card.\nDevelopment Concepts\nBesides using libcxl to initialize and attach a CAPI accelerator to the current process, the hardware design of the AFU constitutes the central part of CAPI development.\nThe AFU is a piece of logic that was configured into the FPGA and therefore the design of the AFU must be expressed in a hardware description language such as VHDL or Verilog. Such language differ significantly from imperative languages like C in that most statements have concurrent semantics as they translate to separate parts of hardware that operate independently from one another. If an algorithm requires several sequential steps, it must be represented in hardware as a state machine.\nThe interface between PSL and AFU is complex and enables an efficient operation and communication with the PSL, but imposes higher efforts on an AFU developer: In order to perform a single read operation three concurrent interfaces must be controlled and monitored, requiring additional states in the AFU state machine. An example provides the figure below, that depicts the structure and state machine of a simple AFU that does nothing more than add two numbers stored in host memory.\n\nState Machine model of the Adder AFU\n\nThe AFU-PSL interface consists of five semi-independent sets of signals, the Job-, Command-, Response-, Read/Write-Buffer- and MMIO-Interface: \n\nThe Job-Interface is controlled by the PSL and indicates job control and reset commands from the host to the AFU. \nThe MMIO-Interface exposes a register view of the AFU to the host that can map this view into its virtual memory to control and monitor the AFU. \nThe Command-Interface is controlled by the AFU, which can issue a variety of read or write commands with different side effects on the Cache Hierarchy. \nThe remaining interfaces are controlled by the PSL and play a role in completing pending commands: A read command causes the PSL to return the requested data via the Write-Buffer-Interface and signal the command completion via the Response-Interface. To perform a write operation, the PSL would read the data to be written via the Read-Buffer-Interface once required.\n\n\nTo support an efficient implementation of the PSL, there are no ordering guarantees on the Buffer-Interfaces. One read command might result in several different results to be written via the Write-Buffer-Interface and transactions belonging to different pending commands are not guaranteed to execute in any order.\n\n\nJobInterface\nVia the job interface the AFU lifecycle is controlled by the PSL. This includes resetting the AFU, initiating jobs and monitoring the AFU's state.\nA transaction on the job interface is qualified by the valid signal and contains a command that is either RESET or START. To both commands the AFU reacts by asserting the done signal once the requested operation is complete. This might be immediately after assertion of valid, as shown in the first (RESET) transaction in the figure below. Otherwise the AFU can delay done by an arbitrary number of clock cycles thereby blocking the PSL and also any host process waiting for the operation to complete.\nIf the command is START, it also qualifies the address signal, that contains the address of the job structure the AFU is meant to work on. As long as the AFU is working, it has to assert the running signal.\n\nMMIO Interface\nThe MMIO (Memory Mapped IO) interface allows the User Design to provide a register based view of the job-independent part of its state and configuration. This view can be mapped into the address space of a host process, which can thus configure the operation of the afu.\nThe same interface is also used by the host to access the AFU Descriptor space, which contains registers with a standardized format (as specified in section 4 of the Manual) that specify the capabilities of the afu device.\nA transaction on the MMIO interface is initiated by the PSL with the assertion of the the valid line. This qualifies the register address, the read/write select, the word/doubleword select and the descriptor/user space select lines. A transaction is finished when the User Design asserts the acknowledge line. For a write transaction the data is presented on the data_in signal while valid is asserted, while a read transaction requires the data to be driven on the data_out signal together with the assertion of acknowledge. The figure below illustrates both a read and a write transaction on the MMIO interface. Please note that the time from the recognition of the valid assertion to the assertion of the acknowledge line can be freely chosen by the user design. In the example below this time is one clock cycle for the read operation and zero clock cycles for the write operation.\n\nCommand Interface, Response Interface, Buffer Interfaces\nEven though the Manual describes them as separate interfaces, the Command, Response and Buffer interfaces are closely coupled in terms of operation semantics. Together they are used by the User Design to exchange data via and manage the cache of the PSL interface. Any such operation is initiated on the Command interface that besides the operation and its parameters (address, ordering criteria, …) establishes a tag value to identify transactions on the other interfaces that are related to this particular operation. This is necessary because multiple operations can be pending at any given time.\nIf an operation is completed, this fact is reported on the Response interface with a response code indicating success or different types of failures.\nRead or write operations are performed with the granularity of one cache line which is equivalent to 128 Bytes/1024 Bits of data. The respective Read Buffer and Write Buffer interfaces are only 512 bits wide so that a complete transfer requires 2 cycles. Each interface indicates by an address line whether the higher or lower portion of the cache line should be accessed by a transaction. There are no restrictions on the order, timing and count of transactions on the Read or Write Buffer interface relating to a single pending command. The same data might be read or written multiple times in which case the data read/written in the most recent transaction is considered valid. It might be noted that the naming of the Read Buffer and Write Buffer interface are chosen from the perspective of the PSL while commands are named according to the User Design perspective. That means, that a write operation requires the User Design to supply the intended data via the Read Buffer interface while a read operation causes the resulting data to be sent via the Write Buffer interface.\nOn the Command, Response, and Write Buffer interface a transaction spans exactly one clock cycle. The respective valid line qualifies the remaining signals. The Read Buffer interface also allows for a transaction to be started on every clock cycle, but each individual transaction finishes after a specific latency that the User Design requires to supply the requested data.\nThe signal trace in the figure below illustrates a  possible transaction sequence for a read command. Some less important signals were omitted from the trace. These include the parity lines that accompany most multibit signals to support error detection. The mapping of the signal names in the trace and those in the Manual is listed in the appendix.\n\nThe figure below shows the progress of a write operation that uses the Read Buffer interface. Please note that the specified read data latency of 1 cycle is not counted from the clock edge of the assertion of the valid line, buf from the edge on that the User Design recognizes its assertion, which is one clock cycle later. Therefore there is a 2 cycle delay between the assertion of the valid line and the driving of the data signals. If the specified read data latency would be 3 (the only other supported value) this delay would increase to 4 cycles.\n\n"},"1-introduction/3-what-is-snap.html":{"url":"1-introduction/3-what-is-snap.html","title":"What is SNAP?","keywords":"","body":"What is SNAP?\nAs much as CAPI builds the technical foundations for effectively using accelerators, it can be hard to adopt due to various reasons:\n\nHaving to write hardware code (Verilog / VHDL) and switching from procedural to state-based thinking may be hard for software engineers\nMany different components that have to be managed individually are part of the build, simulation and execution process\nThe API leaves a lot of responsibility for the user - for example waiting for the completion of memory reads and writes\n\nTherefore SNAP, which is build on top of CAPI, aims to make it as easy as possible to use FPGA-based hardware acceleration. It does that by providing two things: a unified, automated build process and a simpler API on top of CAPI.\nBuild parts\nThe SNAP framework defines a unified build process for building, simulation and execution on hardware.\n\nOverview about artifacts and tools/components involved in the lifecycle of a SNAP AFU\n\nCombining Xilinx Vivado with various other tools and components\nWhile Xilinx Vivado is used to synthesize and layout the action for the FPGA or simulation, there are also many external components that are needed for building. This includes the information which action to build and the PSL layouted for the target FPGA. SNAP bundles all neccessary files and settings while providing a structure of Makefiles to automate building based on them.\nHigh Level Synthesis support\nIncorporating Vivado HLS into the build process allows the action behavior to also be specified in C or C++ which automatically gets converted to hardware code. Even though it is not possible to completely abstract from thinking about pipelining and parallelization, it removes the need for developers to learn VHDL or Verilog.\nReady-to-run examples\nSNAP contains various examples with test data that can be simulated or run on a real device. They help to learn the build flow and act as a stepping stone to creating own actions. A list of the available example actions can be found in the SNAP repository.\nFramework part\nSNAP also tries to abstract from the low level view of CAPI where it is possible without performance impacts.\nSimpler API\nThis includes providing a simpler API for the interaction with the FPGA. When calling an action in CAPI the wait for completion has to be implemented by the caller on the host. In SNAP, the action is prepared by creating a job with a filled parameter struct and then called via the blocking call snap_action_sync_execute_job(action, &job, timeout);\nUnified memory access\nThe FPGA can access different kinds of memory: the host memory as well as its own DRAM and NVMe (i.e. SSD) storage. All are connected via AXI-Buses and can be accessed in the same way. In contrast to CAPI, reading or writing memory does require manually checking when the IO-task is finished.\n"},"2-exploring-an-example-afu/":{"url":"2-exploring-an-example-afu/","title":"Exploring an Example AFU","keywords":"","body":"Exploring an Example AFU\nThis chapter will walk you through the process of compiling one of the examples provided with SNAP; its different components will be explained in the context of the SNAP action development workflow.\nAs an example action, we chose the breadth-first-search (bfs) implementation.\nThe general steps are:\n\nSet up the SNAP environment by installing/cloning its dependencies.

In our setup we used Ubuntu 16.04, but although not officially supported by the needed Vivado version, working with Ubuntu 17.04 should also be possible.\nDownload and installation\nLet's first download, install and configure the software and repositories we need on our development machine.\n1. Xilinx Vivado\nXilinx Vivado is used to synthesize and layout our actions for the FPGA and contains HLS to convert C++ to hardware code as well as xsim (Vivado Simulator) for simulating without an FPGA. Currently version 2016.4 is the latest supported release of Vivado. As the HL WebPACK Edition may not include support for your FPGA-chip we recommend the HL Design Edition. The free 30-day evaluation should work as well (Comparison of different Vivado Editions). You can find the downloads here.\n\nDownload and install Xilinx Vivado\nIf not using the evaluation version, obtain a Vivado license-file (.lic)\nAdd Vivado to your path by sourcing its settings file:~ $ source /opt/Xilinx/Vivado/2016.4/settings64.sh\n\nIf you do not want to repeat this after every reboot, do it automatically on startup by appending it to your bashrc:~ $ echo \"source /opt/Xilinx/Vivado/2016.4/settings64.sh\" >> ~/.bashrc\n\n\n\n\nBecause a Vivado license is usually bound to a specific MAC address, Vivado scans your network adapters to verify the license. However, it only looks for interfaces named eth*. As a result, we had to rename our interface to eth0 on Ubuntu to make it work.\n\n\n2. PSL checkpoint\nOn the FPGA, the Power Service Layer (PSL) manages the communication with the host. This includes translating memory addresses, handling interrupts and virtualizing AFUs if needed. \n\nThe PSL will be part of the circuit on the FPGA and is synthesised and layouted for your specific FPGA, provided as a Vivado checkpoint (.dcp) file. This file contains a snapshot at a certain build step and has to be integrated when building your action. Even when you just want to simulate, you still need a checkpoint file (we recommend the one for the FlashGT card).\n\n\nPlease download the PSL checkpoint for your card here. \n3. Power Service Layer Simulation Engine\nPSLSE is optional and only needed for simulation, but while building for hardware takes a lot of time, building for simulation is comparably fast. Therefore you may want to use simulation even if you have a real chip.\nBecause simulation of hardware is computationally intense, only the actions and not the PSL should be simulated. The PSLSE implements the PSL in software and connects to the (locally hosted) simulation server with the desired action. The host application then communicates to the (locally hosted) PSLSE server instead of an FPGA. \nClone the PSLSE with\n~ $ git clone https://github.com/ibm-capi/pslse\n\n4. SNAP\nNow you still need to clone SNAP itself:\n~ $ git clone https://github.com/open-power/snap\n\nThe repository is split into three folders. The software and hardware folder contain the structures necessary for building software and hardware, while the actions folder contains various examples that are ready to be built. Each action is either prefixed by hdl_ or hls_, indicating whether it is defined in a hardware description language or high level HLS code. Inside each action, the hardware specification lives in hw while the host application is implemented in sw.\nPreparing the build environment\nBefore you can use SNAP for building you have to specify where the components you just installed are. Add Vivado to the path by sourcing the Vivado settings script, point environment variables to the components you just downloaded (omitting PSLSE_ROOT if you did not download PSLSE). Then source the hardware settings script in the SNAP repository:\nsource /opt/Xilinx/Vivado/2016.4/settings64.sh\nexport XILINXD_LICENSE_FILE=\nexport PSL_DCP=\nexport PSLSE_ROOT=\nsource /hardware/snap_settings\n\nTemplate for a script to setup the SNAP environment.\n\n\nAs you have to do this every time you open a new terminal window in which you want to use SNAP, we recommend writing it into a script. You may also call that script in your ~/.bashrc which gets executed automatically once you open a new terminal window.\nWhen executed (or sourced), snap_settings displays the settings for your build:\n=======================================================\n== SNAP SETUP                                        ==\n=======================================================\n=====Checking Xilinx Vivado:===========================\nPath to vivado          is set to: /opt/Xilinx/Vivado/2016.4/bin/vivado\nVivado version          is set to: Vivado v2016.4 (64-bit)\n=====CARD variables====================================\nFPGACARD                is set to: \"FGT\"\nFPGACHIP                is set to: \"xcku060-ffva1156-2-e\"\nPSL_DCP                 is set to: \"/home/balthasar/cards/FGT/portal_20170413/b_route_design.dcp\"\n=====SNAP PATH variables===============================\nSNAP_ROOT               is set to: \"/home/balthasar/repos/snap\"\nACTION_ROOT             is set to: \"/home/balthasar/repos/snap/actions/hdl_example\"\n=====SNAP simulation variables=========================\nSIMULATOR               is set to: \"xsim\"\n=====SNAP function variables===========================\nNUM_OF_ACTIONS          is set to: \"1\"\nSDRAM_USED              is set to: \"FALSE\"\nNVME_USED               is set to: \"FALSE\"\nILA_DEBUG               is set to: \"FALSE\"\nFACTORY_IMAGE           is set to: \"FALSE\"\nExample output of the snap_settings script.\n\n\nDepending on which card you use you may have to change $FPGACARD and $FPGACHIP:\n~ $ export FPGACARD=\n~ $ export FPGACARD=\n\nWhile xsim is the default Simulator and  SNAP_ROOT is set automatically, ACTION_ROOT and the SNAP function variables (SDRAM_USED, NVME_USED) have to be chosen based on the action you want to build.\nSelecting the action to build\nAs an example, let us built one of the provided actions. In order to tell SNAP that you would like to build the breadth-first search action (called hls_bfs because it's implemented using the C-like Vivado HLS language), set ACTION_ROOT to the absolute path of the actions/hls_bfs directory inside your local SNAP repository:\n~ $ export ACTION_ROOT=$SNAP_ROOT/actions/hls_bfs\n\nBecause hls_bfs does not use DRAM or NVMe storage (see the documentation), we leave SDRAM_USED and NVME_USED to FALSE.\nNow, if you have not done so already, change into the hardware directory of your snap repository (cd $SNAP_ROOT/hardware). If all the settings are correct (you can check that by calling ./snap_settings), you can generate the Vivado project files needed to build and simulate the action with:\n$SNAP_ROOT/hardware $ make config\n\nYou can follow the same procedure if you want to build other examples or your own actions.\nWhenever you change one of the snap_settings parameters, you will have to execute make clean config to re-generate the project files. Be careful with cleaning, however, as all previously built model and image files will be lost!\n"},"2-exploring-an-example-afu/2-simulating-an-action.html":{"url":"2-exploring-an-example-afu/2-simulating-an-action.html","title":"Simulating an action","keywords":"","body":"Simulating an action\nThe simulation step is useful if you want to quickly test if your host application can successfully communicate with the AFU. You won't need access to the POWER/FPGA hardware and can generate a simulation model in a much shorter time than a hardware bitstream.\nHowever, the simulation speed is, understandably, much slower than what the real hardware will achieve. Furthermore, although you can trace the flow of different binary signals in Vivado, simulation often isn't useful for debugging HLS AFUs: The HLS code will be converted into a VHDL/Verilog blocks that are quite hard to match to the HLS code. How to debug HLS code will be explained in the following chapter.\nSimulation explained\nSNAP supports several simulators, but in this document we will assume xsim which is included in the Xilinx Vivado Suite and therefore available in all setups.\nAfter SNAP is configured, a simulation model of the user design can be built with:\n$SNAP_ROOT/hardware $ make model\n\nAll HDL sources both from SNAP and the user design are compiled into a simulation model and the simulator configuration is written into a shell script. The simulation of large hardware designs is computationally very expensive. Therefore the resulting model does not include the PSL nor any part of the host side hardware. Nevertheless these components are essential for a user application to access the AFU under test. The solution is the PSLSE (Power Service Layer Simulation Environment) server.\n\nThe PSLSE implements a higher level and thus faster model of the internal CAPI components. It provides a special version of the libcxl, that does not attempt to interact with any CAPI device, but connects to the PSLSE server to access the virtual device it provides. In the same way, the PSL is not simulated as a hardware component, but is only a placeholder, whose behavior on the signal level is controlled by the PSLSE server via a network connection.\n\n\nThe necessary setup of the PSLSE server and its connection to the simulator is done automatically by a script called run_sim. It creates an environment where the regular libcxl is replaced by the PSLSE version. Thus all applications started in this environment will automatically interact with the simulated AFU. The script supports different modes of operation:\n$SNAP_ROOT/hardware/sim $ ./run_sim -explore\n\n$SNAP_ROOT/hardware/sim $ ./run_sim -app ${SNAP_ROOT}/software/tools/snap_maint -arg '-i 3 -vvv'\n\nIf it is run without the -app parameter, it opens a new terminal session with the correctly set up environment to run applications on the simulated hardware. If -app is given, the specified application is executed with the arguments optionally specified by -arg in the simulation environment without creating an interactive session. The -explore option enables an action exploration step before the specified application or terminal session is started. This step is necessary to discover the configuration of the AFU and allow a user application to correctly identify it. This is equivalent to executing the snap_maint tool manually before starting the user application.\nSimulating the breadth-first search AFU\n\nGiven that you've already run make config as described in the previous section, build the simulation image with $SNAP_ROOT/hardware $ make model\n\n\nBefore you can test the model, you will also need to build the consumer application (that will communicate with the simulator through PSLSE):$SNAP_ROOT/actions $ make\n\n\nAs described above, start the the simulation itself:$SNAP_ROOT/hardware/sim $ ./run_sim -explore\n\n\nA new terminal window will open which you can use to launch the test application. The environment in this terminal window is carefully prepared by run_sim which includes the current working directory. Please do not change it as any test application not run from within there can not use the simulated environment.\n/path/to/sim/env $ $SNAP_ROOT/actions/hls_bfs/sw/snap_bfs -v\n\nIf the output ends with\nVisiting node (0): 0, 3, 5, 1, 8, 4, 7, 9, End. Cnt = 8\n\nthe breadth-first search has successfully completed! You can try different configurations by using the options described in $ snap_bfs --help\n\nOnce you're done testing, close the simulation terminal window to shut down the simulator to avoid it consuming CPU cycles unnecessarily.\n\n\n"},"2-exploring-an-example-afu/3-running-on-actual-hardware.html":{"url":"2-exploring-an-example-afu/3-running-on-actual-hardware.html","title":"Running on actual hardware","keywords":"","body":"Running on actual hardware\nCreating a SNAP FPGA image\nOnce you have successfully tested your AFU in the simulator, it is time to actually deploy it to the FPGA.\nTo do that — assuming you've executed make config before — just run make image inside the hardware directory. Synthesizing the image is a memory intensive process and can take any time from 50 minutes to a couple of hours depending on the complexity of your action.\n\nIf you suspect that the model synthesis may fail due to a timing problem (i.e. you have defined complex nested statements in your code), set the TIMING_LABLIMIT environment variable to a large negative value (default: -250 ps) before starting the build. This avoids build failures at a late stage in the process, but may produce images that are not suited for production use. However, you might have success trying them out in a lab environment.\n\n\nOnce the build process has successfully finished, you can find the resulting bitstream files in the build/Image folder under the hardware directory. The version ending in *.bit can be flashed using the JTAG programmer; the *.bin file is meant for the capi-flash-script (see the below sections).\nInstalling the FPGA in the POWER machine\nWe are not responsible for damage you do to your own hardware.\n\nFind a CAPI capable PCIe port which you can use to install the FPGA. For the S824L OpenPOWER machine we used, this information can be obtained in the 'Internal I/O subsystem' section of its technical overview document (page 59 of the PDF in this case).\nInstall the FPGA\nAttach the JTAG programmer to the FPGA and connect its USB cable to an Intel-based machine that will be used to initialize the FPGA with Xilinx' hw_server. Its activity LED will only come on after the Xilinx software has successfully established a connection to the card, so don't worry if it stays off once the systems have booted.\n\nInitializing the FPGA using a JTAG Programmer\nThe official documentation on this topic can be found here.\nAfter the FPGA was installed, usually the Linux OS on the POWER machine will not detect it as a CAPI-enabled device. This is because the image that comes pre-installed on the factory partition of the FPGA doesn't support CAPI; instead a suitable image needs to be flashed onto the user partition by using the external USB programmer.\n\nOnce this procedure is completed and the FPGA is listed under /dev/cxl, new images can be flashed directly from the POWER host using the CAPI tooling provided by IBM. This is described in the next section.\n\n\nIf you would like to set up a headless Vivado installation on the Intel machine connected to the JTAG programmer, you can instead choose to install a lighter weight version of Vivado that includes the hardware server tool hw_server.\nIn any case, the process accessing the programmer (either Vivado or hw_server) might need to run with root privileges. Open Vivado's Hardware Manager and 'open' the target device either on the local server or remotely. Once it has successfully connected to the FPGA, the programmer's activity LED should come on.You will now need a device image (*.bit) that includes at least the PSL component. One way to obtain such an image is to run make image for one of the SNAP examples or your own action. \n\nWhen reviewing your snap_settings, you might notice the FACTORY_IMAGE switch. Because you don't want to overwrite the FPGA's factory partition (but its user partition) you should leave it disabled.\n\n\nBecause the user partition's contents will be cleared on each power cycle of the POWER machine if the card was not yet detected as a CAPI device, a certain procedure is required to initialize it: The image needs to be flashed after the system was powered on, but before the OS performs the PCI Express walk.\nTherefore, set up a ping to the host OS and trigger a reboot (a normal OS reboot should suffice, although sometimes an ipmi power cycle is necessary). Once the ping is lost, start the programming process in Vivado. There should be enough time to fully program the card before the host OS has completed booting.\nProgramming the FPGA directly from the POWER Host\nOnce the FPGA is detected as a CAPI-device it is a lot easier and faster to flash new images onto it. The JTAG programmer and the programming server are no longer needed. You can obtain the necessary tool from GitHub:\n~ $ git clone https://github.com/ibm-capi/capi-utils\n~/capi-utils $ cd capi-utils\n~/capi-utils $ make\n~/capi-utils $ make install\n\nAfterwards, start the tool like this and follow the instructions:\n~ $ capi-flash-script my_image.bin\n\nTesting the breadth-first search action on hardware\nAssuming you have built the bitstream (using make image) and set up the FPGA as described above, the hls_bfs action should by now be programmed onto the card.\nYou will now need a version of SNAP on the POWER server:\n\nBecause now the 'real' version of libcxl is needed (compared to the 'mock' version used earlier by the PSL Simulation Engine), install it (e.g. on Ubuntu):\n~ $ apt install libcxl-dev\n\n\nClone SNAP, build the actions and tooling\n~ $ git clone https://github.com/open-power/snap\n~/snap/software $ make\n~/snap/actions $ make\n\n\nBefore you can use the action for the first time, it needs to be detected by SNAP. Use the snap_maint tool to trigger this:\n~/snap/software/tools $ ./snap_maint -v\n\n\nNow you can execute the breadth-first search on hardware!\n~/snap/actions/hls_bfs/sw $ ./snap_bfs -v\n\n\n\n"},"3-creating-a-new-afu/":{"url":"3-creating-a-new-afu/","title":"Creating a New AFU","keywords":"","body":"Creating a New AFU\nThis chapter will walk you through the complete process of creating an FPGA-based implementation of encrypting and decrypting with the blowfish cipher).\nWe chose it, because it is easy to implement and quite fast when encrypting or decrypting. Only the key-preprocessing when changing the key is expensive. Note that this implementation is not intended for real life use with confidential information but rather a demonstration for SNAP. To effectively use the parallelization capabilities of the FPGA, we chose Electronic Codebook as blockmode, because each block can be en- and decrypted individually. In a real-world scenario, we would recommend CTR.\nAs the key pre-processing is quite expensive, we want to be able to handle large data streams with one pre-processing pass. Therefore we decided to include three operations in our action:\n\nSet the key\nEncrypt data with the current key\nDecrypt data with the current key\n\nEach call to our action will specify one of these operations.\n\nWhen the action is called, the SNAP library automatically writes the job struct residing in host memory to the AFU's IO Register space (MMIO). This space is implemented by a SNAP hardware component and available to the user design via the action_reg * parameter. How the AFU uses this parameter to access the job struct will be explained in the Hardware Development section. \n\n\nWe create an empty repository outside of the SNAP folder structure and call it hls_blowfish.

After that we need to de-select the action and free the card to make it usable for others again.\nint main()\n{\n    int card_no = 0;\n    unsigned long timeout = 10000;\n    struct snap_card *card = NULL;\n    struct snap_action *action = NULL;\n    snap_action_flag_t action_irq = (SNAP_ACTION_DONE_IRQ | SNAP_ATTACH_IRQ);\n\n    // Hardcoded card number for simplicity\n    card = snap_card_alloc_dev(\"/dev/cxl/afu0.0s\", SNAP_VENDOR_ID_IBM, SNAP_DEVICE_ID_SNAP);\n\n    if (card == NULL) {\n        fprintf(stderr, \"err: failed to open card %u: %s\\n\",\n            card_no, strerror(errno));\n            return 1;\n    }\n\n    action = snap_attach_action(card, BLOWFISH_ACTION_TYPE, action_irq, 60);\n    blowfish_test(action, timeout);\n\n    snap_detach_action(action);\n    snap_card_free(card);\n    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nThe main method of our minimal blowfish test.\n\n\nAgain, for the complete implementation, please refer to the code on Github.\nNow we can call make in hls_blowfish/sw_minimal to build our software part and use it like described in Simulating an action or Running on actual hardware. If you use the default directory name (sw), building is done automatically when calling make model on your development machine. Please remember that, when using real hardware, you want to build the software part on the POWER machine to avoid cross compiling.\n\nDue to CAPI reading only full cache lines (128 byte), you have to allocate addresses that you want to share 128 byte aligned. Also, when choosing the size of our test data, only full 64 bytes arrived at the FPGA. When using less data, only zeros arrived.\n\n\nFurther comments\nOur minimal implementation lacks error handling and is inflexible due to hardcoded information. To bring it to the level of a SNAP example, it would need some more features, including commmand line options, file reading and debug output. You can find the code for the real example in the same repository located in the sw folder: snap_blowfish.c.\nIf you clone the whole repository, it can be used like the original examples with both, sw and sw_minimal, containing working host programs. We also — like it is done in other examples — included a software implementation of the blowfish algorithm in hls_blowfish/sw/action_blowfish.c. Although not necessary for the hardware implementation itself, maintaining such a separate implementation of the AFU is often a good idea. Besides being a reference for testing the hardware implementation correctness, is also serves as a baseline for performance analyses.\n"},"3-creating-a-new-afu/2-hardware-development.html":{"url":"3-creating-a-new-afu/2-hardware-development.html","title":"Hardware Development","keywords":"","body":"Hardware Development\nAs mentioned earlier, SNAP supports hardware development with Vivado HLS, that translates C/C++ code to VHDL or Verilog. Subsequently both the translation tool and the C/C++ subset it can translate will be called HLS.\nThe HLS translation process tries to group the original sequential statements into groups, that can be executed in parallel. This involves tracing the control and data dependencies between those statements. The groups of parallel statements become states of a state machine and its transitions are determined according to the control structures in the original code. This state machine controls a data path that is capable of executing all required operations defined by the original statements. Consequently, the resulting synchronous hardware design implements the same functionality as the original code. This enables software developers to quickly port existing algorithms to a hardware implementation without in-depth knowledge of traditional hardware development principles.\nFor some easily parallelizable algorithms the results of this process might be good enough to achieve substantial speedups, as HLS recognizes the optimization potential and generates parallel hardware. In the general case however, the formulation of an algorithm that is optimized for a sequential execution model is not a favorable candidate for automatic optimization: HLS has hardly the same domain knowledge of a hardware developer, who knows (or guesses) how best to restructure the algorithm to distribute the workload well among the available resources.\nTherefore HLS provides a set of annotations (#pragma HLS ...) that allow a developer to direct the hardware generation process in specific ways to give a more fine grained control over the generated hardware. In some specific cases it might even be necessary to restructure the C code by hand in order to make HLS generate the intended hardware structures.\nA basic SNAP AFU project consists of two files in the hardware (hw) subdirectory of the action repository: One hardware specific header file, and the C implementation. In our case these are action_blowfish.H and hls_blowfish.cpp. Note the capital H in the header file extension. This convention is used to distinguish the hardware specific from the common header file action_blowfish.h. The latter contains the definition of the job structure and is thus included in both the hardware and software implementation.\nPorting the Algorithm to HLS\nThe first step of the AFU development is the implementation of the actual algorithm in HLS. Depending on the style and complexity of an existing software implementation, it might be more or less easy to adapt it to the limitations of HLS' subset of C/C++: Dynamic memory allocation and some pointer operations are not supported and algorithms relying on dynamic data structures need to be reorganized to fit into the more static nature of a hardware implementation.\nBlowfish however operates on blocks of a fixed size and needs only a fixed set of intermediate results, which makes the port to hardware easy. The Wikipedia article provides a compact pseudocode representation, that needs only minor adaptions to serve as a first step to the AFU implementation:\nstatic bf_halfBlock_t bf_f(bf_halfBlock_t h)\n{\n    bf_SiE_t a = (bf_SiE_t)(h >> 24),\n             b = (bf_SiE_t)(h >> 16),\n             c = (bf_SiE_t)(h >> 8),\n             d = (bf_SiE_t) h;\n    return ((g_S[0][a] + g_S[1][b]) ^ g_S[2][c]) + g_S[3][d];\n}\n\nstatic void bf_encrypt(bf_halfBlock_t & left, bf_halfBlock_t & right)\n{\n    for (bf_PiE_t i = 0; i  0; i -= 2) {\n        left ^= g_P[i+1];\n        right ^= bf_f(left, iCpy);\n        right ^= g_P[i];\n        left ^= bf_f(right, iCpy);\n    }\n    bf_halfBlock_t tmp = left ^g_P[1];\n    left = right ^ g_P[0];\n    right = tmp;\n}\n\nstatic void bf_keyInit(bf_halfBlock_t key[18])\n{\n    for (bf_PiE_t i = 0; i \nWhen porting pseudocode or existing C code to HLS, care should be taken when choosing data types: In software development it does not usually make a difference in terms of performance, if much wider data types than necessary are used, provided they do not exceed the underlying machine's native register width. When specifying hardware however, a data type's bit width has a significant impact on the size and performance of a design.\nThe generated hardware is exactly large enough to process the specified bit count. During the translation process it is generally impossible to determine the range of values a variable might take at runtime so that the worst case must be assumed. Therefore it is advisable to specify the bit width of a variable as tightly as possible. To enable a finer control, the template types ap_uint and ap_int can be parameterized to represent any integral bit width.\nThis can be seen in the code above. Instead of using the usual int for loop counters, specific types such as bf_SiE were selected, that are defined in the hardware specific header.\nTest Bench I\nThe hardware implementation (hls_blowfish.cpp) can define a main() function, that should be non-synthesizable. It will be the entry point for debugging and should contain a testbench for the HLS code.\n\nWhen building an AFU there often arises the need for debugging. The classic approach in hardware development is to simulate the design on a testbench that applies predefined signal sequences to the design under test and monitors how it reacts. This procedure is perfectly possible with an HLS design as the C code is translated to VHDL modules that act like any user written hardware design. Nevertheless the translation process produces somewhat cryptic names for states and signals. Furthermore the state machine is not easily comprehensible to a developer used to C code and the mapping between states and C statements is not obvious. Therefore it is desirable to run the HLS code like a regular C program in a software debugger to fix errors on that level, always assuming that the translated hardware modules behave exactly as the original C code.\n\n\nIn a later stage of the development, the test bench will set up a complete SNAP environment to execute the AFU code in software just as if it was invoked in hardware. For now it is sufficient to write test cases for the algorithm to debug the implementation and ensure its correctness before the SNAP integration can begin. The example below shows how the encrypt function could be tested.\n#ifdef NO_SYNTH\nint main()\n{\n    bf_halfBlock_t left = 0xda7a, right = 0xb10c;\n    printf(\"encrypt(0x%08x, 0x%08x) -> \", left, right);\n    bf_encrypt(left, right);\n    printf(\"0x%08x, 0x%08x\\n\", left, right);\n}\n#endif\n\nThe Vivado HLS IDE is used to run such a test bench. Once installed it should be started from a shell with all SNAP environment variables set up. The project to be opened is the directory in ${ACTION_ROOT}/hw that contains an FPGA part number in its name. In this case it would be ${SNAP_ROOT}/actions/hls_blowfish/hw/hlsBlowfish_xcku060-ffva1156-2-e.\n\nVivado HLS: Synthesis View and Project Settings Dialog\n\nBefore running the testbench, the hardware source file hls_blowfish.cpp must be added as a simulation source, by right clicking Test Bench in the project explorer and selecting Add Files... . Furthermore some SNAP specific CFLAGS must be set up by opening the Project -> Project Settings dialog and editing the CFLAGS of the hls_blowfish.cpp file in the Simulation Tab. The flags to use are documented in the SNAP Action Readme on GitHub. At the time of writing the required flags were:\n-DNO_SYNTH -I./include -I../../software/include -I.//include\nAfterwards by pressing the Run C Simulation icon in the toolbar the simulation will be started and the Debug view entered, where the usual functionality of a C debugger is available.\n\nVivado HLS: Debug View and Simulation in Progress\n\nIntegration with the SNAP Framework\nThe next step on the way to a working Blowfish-AFU is to adapt its structure to the SNAP framework. SNAP expects a module named hls_action and instantiates it as the AFU user design when composing the final design on the FPGA.\nHLS translates all functions to separate VHDL modules unless they are inlined. Consequently the AFU code must contain a function named hls_action() that will be the entry point to the AFU logic.\nThe arguments of this function represent different parts of the environment that SNAP offers to an AFU: They include pointers to host memory, a pointer to the job structure and if enabled a pointer to the cards local memory. (See USE_DRAM=TRUE with make config). hls_action() is called each time the job interface of the PSL indicates that a job should be started.\nAll AFUs must be able to introduce themselves to the host with their action code and hardware revision. There is a list of assigned action codes in the SNAP repository named ActionTypes.md. A new action code is registered by a successful merge request that adds the new assignment to that list. There is however a large range of codes reserved for experimental use which - though with the risk of collisions - should be ideal for the private development of a new AFU. The hardware revision is at the discretion of the developer and should only be increased if significant changes in the host visible AFU interface or behavior have occurred.\nIf the host queries this information, hls_action() is entered just as if a regular job was started. To distinguish both cases, a flag in the control register is set to indicate that instead of executing a job the AFU should write the respective entries in a configuration memory space, accessible through a pointer argument to hls_action().\nThe specific code that implements this behavior can be seen below and - as it is not specific to a particular AFU - can be freely reused.\nvoid hls_action(snap_membus_t  *din_gmem, snap_membus_t  *dout_gmem,\n                action_reg *action_reg, action_RO_config_reg *Action_Config)\n{\n    // Host Memory AXI Interface\n#pragma HLS INTERFACE m_axi port=din_gmem bundle=host_mem offset=slave depth=512\n#pragma HLS INTERFACE m_axi port=dout_gmem bundle=host_mem offset=slave depth=512\n#pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=din_gmem bundle=ctrl_reg offset=0x030\n#pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=dout_gmem bundle=ctrl_reg offset=0x040\n\n    // Host Memory AXI Lite Master Interface\n#pragma HLS DATA_PACK variable=Action_Config\n#pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=Action_Config bundle=ctrl_reg  offset=0x010\n#pragma HLS DATA_PACK variable=action_reg\n#pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=action_reg bundle=ctrl_reg offset=0x100\n#pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=return bundle=ctrl_reg\n\n    /* Required Action Type Detection */\n    switch (action_reg->Control.flags) {\n        case 0:\n            Action_Config->action_type = (snapu32_t)BLOWFISH_ACTION_TYPE;\n            Action_Config->release_level = (snapu32_t)HW_RELEASE_LEVEL;\n            action_reg->Control.Retc = (snapu32_t)0xe00f;\n            break;\n        default:\n            action_reg->Control.Retc = process_action(din_gmem, dout_gmem, action_reg);\n            break;\n    }\n}\n\nExcerpt of hls_blowfish.cpp\n\nTo separate this mechanism from the actual logic, the Blowfish AFU calls process_action() if the hls_action() invocation was not a configuration request. This function is the first AFU specific part and the right place to extract all necessary parameters and commands from the job structure. This is accessible via the action_reg * act_reg parameter. It contains the general AFU control registers in act_reg->Control and the AFU specific job struct in its act_reg->Data member, which is organized as specified in the common action_blowfish.h header. \nWhen using members of the type struct snap_addr care should be taken, as they not only include the actual address, but only fields for the length of the specified address range, the type of memory referenced and some flags intended for later use in the SNAP framework.\nThe Blowfish example uses only the address part of this struct and thus the job struct decoding looks as follows:\n    snapu64_t inAddr = action_reg->Data.input_data.addr;\n    snapu64_t outAddr = action_reg->Data.output_data.addr;\n    snapu32_t byteCount = action_reg->Data.data_length;\n    snapu32_t mode = action_reg->Data.mode;\n\nExcerpt of hls_blowfish.cpp process_action()\n\n\nThe Blowfish AFU provides three separate operations: Encryption, decryption and key initialization. They are distinguished by specific values of the mode field and use the input and output buffers if applicable. To maintain a clear structure, the operations are implemented in separate functions: action_setkey() performs the key initialization, whereas action_endecrypt() handles both en- and decryption as they are very similar. These functions contain the required memory access logic to execute the Blowfish algorithm consisting of the bf_*() functions efficiently.\nTest Bench II\nWith the SNAP action code in place, the testbench should be changed accordingly, to call hls_action() with a correctly set up environment. This includes arrays of the snap_membus_t type for each bus that is connected to the action module, i.e. two buses to host memory and optionally one to the DRAM, as well as the action and config registers (action_reg and act_R0_config_reg). The memory arrays must be initialized to contain the data, on which the action will operate. The action register must contain a correctly initialized job structure. The config register contains the flag to distinguish discovery from normal mode and this flag is the only part that needs to be set for test bench purposes.\nWith all these preparations in place hls_action() can be called so that all parts of the action functionality are covered by the test bench. Should that produce incorrect results, breakpoints and variable inspection are effective means to find the bug.\nvoid main()\n{\n    static snap_membus_t din_gmem[1024];\n    static snap_membus_t dout_gmem[1024];\n    action_reg act_reg;\n    action_RO_config_reg act_config;\n    static const uint8_t ptext[] = { /* ... */ };\n    static const uint8_t key[] = { /* ... */ };\n\n    // Perform Action Discovery\n    act_reg.Control.flags = 0x0;\n    hls_action(din_gmem, dout_gmem, &act_reg, &act_config);\n\n    // Setup memory\n    memcpy((uint8_t *)(void *)&din_gmem[0], key, sizeof(key)); // key 8B @ 0x0\n    memcpy((uint8_t *)(void *)&din_gmem[2], ptext, sizeof(ptext)); // plaintext 16B @ 0x80\n\n    // Test Key Initialization\n    act_reg.Control.flags = 0x1;\n    act_reg.Data.input_data.addr = 0;\n    act_reg.Data.data_length = 8;\n    act_reg.Data.mode = MODE_SET_KEY;\n    hls_action(din_gmem, dout_gmem, &act_reg, &act_config);\n\n    // Test Encryption\n    act_reg.Control.flags = 0x1;\n    act_reg.Data.input_data.addr = 2 * sizeof(snap_membus_t);\n    act_reg.Data.output_data.addr = 4 * sizeof(snap_membus_t);\n    act_reg.Data.data_length = sizeof(ptext);\n    act_reg.Data.mode = MODE_ENCRYPT;\n    hls_action(din_gmem, dout_gmem, &act_reg, &act_config);\n}\n\nExcerpt of hls_blowfish.cpp\n\nUsing the SNAP Environment\nWith the memory and register pointers passed to hls_action() SNAP already provides everything to access the resources available to an AFU. By dereferencing and using pointer arithmetic, different memory areas can be read and written. After the job structure pointer, that translates to an interface to a job management module provided by SNAP, the most interesting resource to any AFU will be host memory.\nWhen interacting with host memory, there arises a slight incongruity: While a regular bus interface can be expected to be bidirectional, SNAP provides two separate interfaces for host memory access, one for read and one for write operations. This is due to the way Vivado HLS translates bus interfaces, which is not quite compatible with SNAPs PSL interface module.\nsnap_membus_t result = din_gmem[address >> ADDR_RIGHT_SHIFT];\n\nThe statement above performs a single read operation from host memory. The result is a snap_membus_t which represents one word with the native bus width of the underlying PSL interface. The bus width is 512 bit, so only 64 byte aligned accesses to 64 byte blocks of data are possible. The addresses specified by the host software will generally be byte addresses, while the host memory pointer is indexed in multiples of 64 bytes. That necessitates the right shift of the byte address. Care should be taken if the lower bits of the byte address are not 0. In that case the desired part must be extracted from the result according to those lower bits.\n"},"3-creating-a-new-afu/3-optimization.html":{"url":"3-creating-a-new-afu/3-optimization.html","title":"Optimization","keywords":"","body":"Optimization\nAfter the first correct version of the AFU is flashed on the FPGA and tested, there usually comes a surprise: Without explicit optimization, very few algorithms perform better on the FPGA than on the CPU and after all the effort spent to port the algorithm the reward might be longer runtimes. This picture might however change significantly, after the design is properly optimized for the platform it is meant to run on.\nDue to their generic structure FPGAs support much lower clock frequencies in comparison to CPUs. The value of an FPGA solution lies in the fact, that problems can be solved with parallel hardware that implements exactly the required functionality in few clock cycles, instead of using sequential general purpose instructions.\nAs it is generally not obvious, in what way an algorithm can be most efficiently parallelized, it is the task of the AFU developer to annotate the HLS code sufficiently to point out parallelization possibilities and remove obstacles such as false dependencies. The Vivado HLS IDE provides a valuable tool in its Analysis View, that visualizes the generated state machines. It can be used to explore the complexity and runtime of the hardware generated for different sections of HLS code and to judge the effect that a particular annotation has on the overall performance. Details on how to use the Analysis View and in-depth information on optimization best practices can be found in the official IBM course material.\nPerformance Analysis\nAnother important consideration is whether one particular parallelization (that duplicates the required hardware resources by the respective factor) really improves the focused overall performance indicator. In a throughput oriented scenario like the Blowfish AFU it seems sensible to use multiple instances of the encrypt function to encrypt multiple blocks in parallel. This measure is however only useful, if the data blocks can be transferred from host memory with a sufficient rate. Otherwise the throughput is limited by the host memory bus and a far more useful strategy would be to improve memory throughput by implementing intelligent buffering and prefetching strategies.\nThe best starting point for optimizations can often be found by experimenting with the real hardware. Thus our first step to optimize the Blowfish AFU was to perform two series of throughput measurements. The first only reads and writes back data blocks without encrypting them but keeping the same access patterns. In the second series the AFU does not interact with host memory at all but only performs the requested number of encryption runs on a dummy data block. Based on this information as visualized in the plot below, we determined that the encrypt function is the bottleneck and that an encrypt speedup of up to 16 times will benefit the overall performance.\n\nMemory and encryption throughput for different input sizes (in bytes)\n\n\nImproving Encrypt Performance\nTo speed up the encryption process, it is necessary to use parallel instances of the encrypt function on separate blocks of data. Because of the internal block structure of the Blowfish cipher, most operations during the encryption of one particular block depend directly on the results of its predecessors, which makes improving the single block encrypt performance by parallelization impossible.\nEncrypting multiple blocks in parallel imposes however a severe limitation on the feasible cipher modes. All chaining modes make the encryption of a block dependent on the result for the previous encryption, which collides with parallel block encryption unless several different data streams are to be encrypted concurrently. This leaves ECB and CTR mode. While ECB has severe security limitations, CTR mode provides a sufficient level of security.\nTherefore the parallel encryption of data blocks — though limiting — is still a valid paradigm.\nIn order to effectively utilize multiple instances of the encrypt function, care must be taken to coordinate access to resources shared by all instances, i.e. the S and P arrays.\nWith no key initialization operation pending, these arrays are read only resources, so that no inconsistent states can arise from multiple instances interacting with the arrays in parallel. However the read access patterns among the instances are problematic: While the P array accesses are the same for every bf_encrypt() instance given a synchronized invocation, the four S array accesses performed by the bf_f() subroutine are data dependent, forbidding any prediction about common or regular access patterns.\nIn this situation it is necessary to understand how arrays are implemented on the FPGA hardware: One or more Block RAM resources are instantiated to create a contiguous memory space large enough to hold the array, which is later mapped into that space. Each Block RAM has two access ports, so that in one clock cycle two independent memory operations can be performed.\nMore than two parallel instances of bf_f() require more than two memory access ports to the S array. This particular read-only-case permits to overcome this limitation by maintaining a sufficient (#instances/2) number of copies. This is however only useful, if each copy of the array is mapped into its particular set of Block RAMs so that no two copies share one Block RAM. To achieve this, HLS provides an annotation to control how arrays are mapped to Block RAMs:\n//in action_blowfish.H\ntypedef ap_uint bf_S_t[BF_S_CPYCNT][BF_S_ARYCNT][BF_S_ENTCNT];\n\n//in hls_blowfish.cpp\nstatic bf_S_t g_S;\n\n//in hls_blowfish.cpp:hls_action()\n#pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION variable=g_S complete dim=1\n\nThis example shows, how a third dimension is added to the originally two-dimensional S array to provide space for its copies. The #pragma, which must be placed inside a function (preferably the entry point hls_action()), partitions g_S completely along the copy dimension ensuring that each copy resides in a separate Block RAM.\nWith an appropriate number of read ports, it is now necessary that the generated hardware structures utilize them efficiently. This involves explicit scheduling, which instance of bf_f() reads from which copy of the S array.\nOne way to do this would be to introduce a new parameter as a copy id, that controls with which copy bf_f() interacts. However, unless the function is inlined, it will require an explicit interface to any resource it might interact with, thus making each instance of bf_f() consume one port of each copy and rendering the previous port multiplication efforts useless.\nstatic bf_halfBlock_t bf_f(bf_halfBlock_t h, bf_SiC_t iCpy)\n{\n    bf_SiE_t a = (bf_SiE_t)(h >> 24),\n             b = (bf_SiE_t)(h >> 16),\n             c = (bf_SiE_t)(h >> 8),\n             d = (bf_SiE_t) h;\n    return ((g_S[iCpy][0][a] + g_S[iCpy][1][b]) ^ g_S[iCpy][2][c]) + g_S[iCpy][3][d];\n}\n\nOriginal scalar implementation of f() with copy id parameter. (hls_blowfish.cpp)\n\n\nTo circumvent this limitation of function semantics, we restructured the code to implement all required parallel bf_f() invocations in a single function call. This introduces the new function bf_fLine(), that operates on a whole array of arguments and returns the results in a separate array of the same size. In the following listing BF_BPL is a preprocessor macro that denotes the number of blocks, that should be processed in parallel. \nTo ensure that all iterations of the loop are executed in parallel, the UNROLL pragma is used. Unfortunately these pragmas can not resolve preprocessor macros, so that the value of BF_BPL must be specified manually. bf_fLine() requires BF_BPL ports to the S array and performs four sequential read operations on each of them to produce the results of BF_BPL independent bf_f() invocations. As one copy copy of the S array can serve two read ports, the copy index is derived from the argument array index divided by two.\nstatic void bf_fLine(bf_halfBlock_t res[BF_BPL], bf_halfBlock_t h[BF_BPL])\n{\n    BF_F_LINE:\n    for (bf_uiBpL_t iBlock = 0; iBlock > 24),\n                 b = (bf_SiE_t)(h[iBlock] >> 16),\n                 c = (bf_SiE_t)(h[iBlock] >> 8),\n                 d = (bf_SiE_t) h[iBlock];\n\n        res[iBlock] = ((g_S[iBlock/2][0][a] + g_S[iBlock/2][1][b]) ^\n                        g_S[iBlock/2][2][c]) + g_S[iBlock/2][3][d];\n    }\n}\n\nParallelized array implementation of f(). (hls_blowfish.cpp)\n\n\nbf_fLine() is only useful to a a variant of encrypt(), that operates on multiple data blocks in parallel. This new function bf_encryptLine() also requires array versions of the previously scalar XOR operations. The functions bf_xorOne() and bf_xorAll() provide this functionality and should be self explanatory. The following listing contrasts the scalar and array versions of the encrypt function:\nstatic void bf_encrypt(bf_halfBlock_t & left, bf_halfBlock_t & right)\n{\n    BF_ENCRYPT:\n    for (int i = 0; i \nstatic void bf_encryptLine(bf_halfBlock_t leftHBlocks[BF_BPL],\n                           bf_halfBlock_t rightHBlocks[BF_BPL])\n{\n    BF_ENCRYPT_LINE:\n    for (int i = 0; i \nComparison of the scalar and array encrypt() implementations (hls_blowfish.cpp)\n\n\n\n\nTODO\n[! improve memory throughput, 4k buffering]\n[! results and conclusion, comparison to CPU solution] \n"}}}
