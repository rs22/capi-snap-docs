# What is SNAP?

CAPI is nice, several reasons why it may be hard to get into:  
VHDL hardware code, state instead of procedural thinking  
Lot of different parts  
Manual memory management \(waiting for reads and writes, ...\)

Therefore CAPI SNAP, which aims to make it as easy as possible to use FPGA-based hardware acceleration. It does that by providing two things: a unified, automated build process and a simpler API on top of CAPI.
