## Debugging with the Vivado Testbench

When building an action there often arises the need for debugging. The classic approach in hardware development is to simulate the design on a testbench that applies predefined signal sequences to the design under test and monitors how it reacts. This procedure is perfectly possible with an HLS design as the C code is translated to VHDL modules that act like any user written hardware design. Nevertheless the translation process produces somewhat cryptic names for states and signals. Furthermore the state machine is not easily comprehensible to a developer used to C code and the mapping between states and C statements is not obvious. Therefore it is desirable to run the HLS code like a regular C program in a software debugger to fix errors on that level, always assuming that the translated hardware modules behave exactly as the original C code.
